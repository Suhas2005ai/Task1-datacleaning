# Mall Customers Data Cleaning Project

## About This Project
This project is all about **cleaning and preparing the Mall Customers dataset**. It contains information like Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score. After cleaning, the dataset is ready for analysis or 
customer segmentation.  

## Dataset
- **Original file:** `Mall_Customers.csv`  
- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Customer Segmentation Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  
- **Cleaned file:** `cleaned_mall_customers.csv` (missing values handled, duplicates removed, text standardized, and column names fixed)

## What I Did
1. Loaded the dataset using Python and pandas.  
2. Checked for missing values and handled them.  
3. Removed any duplicate rows.  
4. Standardized text columns (like Gender) for consistency.  
5. Converted numeric columns to the correct data types.  
6. Renamed columns to lowercase with underscores for easy use.  
7. Saved the cleaned dataset for future use.
